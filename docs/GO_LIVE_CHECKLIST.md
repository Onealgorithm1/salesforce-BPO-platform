# Lead Enrichment Platform — Go-Live Checklist (Track H)

_v1.0 · Org 00Dbn00000plgUfEAI · gate for enabling live enrichment · every item requires sign-off_

Do **not** enable live enrichment until every **Required** item is checked. Current status shown; ☐ = to do.

## 1. Runtime user & security
- [x] `OA_Lead_Enrichment_Runtime` permission set **assigned** to the runtime user and **kept assigned** (1 assignment).
- [x] Runtime-user exception documented + accepted (`RUNTIME_USER_EXCEPTION.md`) — temporary `oauser` (MAD).
- [ ] **(Required before scheduled/24-7)** Dedicated **least-privilege runtime user** provisioned (needs a Salesforce license). *Top standing risk.*
- [x] `OA_Connector_Staging` / SAM connector permset **unassigned** except JIT (verified 0).

## 2. Credentials (`CREDENTIAL_STATUS.md`)
- [x] USASpending NC + endpoint (public) — ready.
- [x] IRS — no credential needed (bulk CSV).
- [ ] **SAM:** set NC endpoint + grant EC principal access (JIT) + confirm data.gov key valid.
- [ ] **Census:** create NC `OA_Census` → `https://api.census.gov`.
- [ ] **SEC:** create NC `OA_SEC` → `https://data.sec.gov` (User-Agent).

## 3. Execution & scheduling (`SCHEDULING_PLAN.md`)
- [x] Orchestrator (`OA_EnrichmentOrchestrator`) + Queueable built, validated (validate id `0AfPn0000023185KAA`, 6/6 tests).
- [ ] Batch sizes set per `PERFORMANCE_VALIDATION.md` (50 callout / 200 IRS / start 20).
- [ ] First schedule runs **`commitWrites=false`** (preview) for one cycle, then flips to commit.
- [ ] No schedule activated until manual canary + 25-Lead + 100-Lead pilots pass. *(0 enrichment jobs today.)*

## 4. Monitoring & alerts
- [ ] Dashboards built from `MONITORING_DASHBOARDS.md` (Executive + Platform Health).
- [ ] Alert thresholds + subscriptions wired (`OPERATIONAL_ALERTS.md`); failure email to `lronealgorithm@gmail.com`.

## 5. Backup & rollback
- [x] Change-log + before-snapshot audit built and **proven** (Sprint-16 canary + 5-Lead pilot, 5/5 restored).
- [x] `OA_ChangeLogService.rollback(...)` verified deterministic.
- [ ] Rollback rehearsed once against a live pilot run before scaling.

## 6. Source control & release
- [x] v1.0 baseline: tag `lead-enrichment-v1.0` = `485f7dc` (pushed; not retagged).
- [x] **Sprint 17 MERGED to `main` (2026-07-07, Sprint 19)** — fast-forward `485f7dc..59f9df0`, validated `0AfPn00000235zhKAA` (6/6), pushed to origin. `main = origin/main = 59f9df0`.
- [x] Platform frozen — Sprint 17 added only operational classes (no platform/connector edits).
- [ ] **Sprint 17 execution layer NOT yet deployed to the org** (orchestrator/queueable/adapter count = 0 in prod; only check-only validated). Required before any pilot.
- [x] Census + SEC Named Credentials prepared + check-only validated (`0AfPn00000236CbKAI`); not deployed.

## 7. Deployment history (for the record)
| Deploy / validate | ID | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Lead enrichment fields (29) | `0AfPn0000022znpKAA` | 29/29 |
| Platform types | `0AfPn0000022zz7KAA` | 184/184 |
| CMDT records (44) | `0AfPn000002308nKAA` | 44/44 |
| Runtime permset (4 obj + 99 field) | `0AfPn00000230aDKAQ` | 1/1 |
| Full-platform validation | `0AfPn0000022zW5KAI` | 86 tests, 97.21% |
| Sprint-17 orchestrator validation | `0AfPn0000023185KAA` | 6 tests, 0 errors |

## 8. Support contacts
- **Owner / decision-maker:** Louis (`lronealgorithm@gmail.com`).
- **Platform escalation:** Salesforce Support — **not warranted** for the known FLS behavior
  (`SALESFORCE_SUPPORT_PACKAGE.md`); open only for a genuine FLS-independent anomaly.

## Sprint 20 update (2026-07-07) — live preview validated
- [x] **Preview proven live** — full pipeline over the 25 pilot Leads via USASpending: 8/25 matched, 56 proposals, **0 writes** (`dmlRows=0`), platform stayed dormant. Detail: `SPRINT20_OPERATIONAL_READINESS.md`.
- [ ] **Activate a fill-empty write policy** (0 of 19 active) — required before any real write. Under fill-empty the preview would fill 48 blank fields and route 8 `State` conflicts to the exception queue (no overwrite).
- [ ] Execution engine (`OA_EnrichmentOrchestrator`) still not deployed — required for batch/scheduled, **not** for the direct-path 25-Lead write.

## Sprint 21 update (2026-07-07) — write pilot BLOCKED (fix prepared)
- [ ] **Fill-empty policies not yet active.** Deployed USASpending policies were **2 Overwrite + 3 missing** (not fill-empty). Corrected 5 policies (2 Overwrite→FillEmptyOnly + 3 new), **Active=false**, check-only validated `0AfPn00000238RJKAY` (Succeeded). Activation (Active=true + deploy) is the gated write step.
- [ ] **Concurrent session in the org** (LinkedIn/OAuth check-only validations) — coordinate before the first production write.
- [x] Pre-flight PASS; 25 Leads verified unchanged; 8 matched targets all blank; before-snapshot saved; rollback ready. Detail: `SPRINT21_25_LEAD_WRITE_PILOT.md`.

## Sprint 22 update (2026-07-07) — policies deployed; write blocked by rate-limit
- [x] **Corrected fill-empty policies DEPLOYED + verified** — all 6 USASpending fields FillEmptyOnly (2 Overwrite→FillEmptyOnly permanently corrected in prod, 3 new). 0 Overwrite active. Then deactivated to dormant (0 active policies).
- [x] Preview repeated with active policies — matched Sprint 20 (8 matched, 48 fill-empty, 0 conflicts, dmlRows=0).
- [ ] **First production write NOT completed** — USASpending rate-limited all callouts (transient); 0 Leads written; platform safe. Retry the 8-matched-Lead write after cooldown (reactivate policies → write, spaced). Detail: `SPRINT22_FIRST_PRODUCTION_WRITE.md`.

## Sprint 23 update (2026-07-07) — FIRST PRODUCTION WRITE SUCCEEDED ✅
- [x] **First controlled write complete:** 8 Leads enriched, **48 fields written**, 0 overwrites, 48 audited change logs w/ before-snapshots, rollback verified. Returned to dormant (0 active policies, 8 Leads enriched preserved).
- [x] **Root-cause correction:** Sprint-22 "rate limit" was actually a DML-before-callout `CalloutException`. Fix = callout before DML. Not an API/connector issue.
- [ ] 100-Lead pilot (next) · least-privilege runtime user (before 24/7) · orchestrator deploy (before batch/scheduled).

## Sprint 24 update (2026-07-07) — 100-Lead acceptance pilot: ACCEPTED WITH CONDITIONS
- [x] **100-Lead pilot complete:** 60 matched, **54 enriched (324 fields), 0 overwrites**, audited, reversible; KPI baseline set (`KPI_BASELINE.md`). Returned to dormant (62 Leads enriched preserved).
- [ ] **DEFECT #1:** `Awarding_Agencies__c` (255) too small for multi-agency contractors → 6/60 silent `STRING_TOO_LONG` failures. Fix (widen field or truncate in mapper) + re-enrich the 6 Leads.
- [ ] **DEFECT #2:** `OA_EnrichmentWriter` ignores `Database.update` SaveResults → commits change logs for failed updates, routes no exception. Fix before scaled/automated use.
- Full detail: `SPRINT24_PRODUCTION_ACCEPTANCE_REPORT.md`.

## Sprint 25 update (2026-07-07) — CERTIFIED (v1.1)
- [x] **Both acceptance defects fixed + deployed** (deploy `0AfPn0000023BnNKAU`, 261 tests, 0 failures): `Awarding_Agencies__c`→Long Text Area; `OA_EnrichmentWriter` inspects SaveResults.
- [x] **6 failed Leads repaired** (6/6 enriched); orphan audit cleaned; **audit exactly matches DB** (68 Leads, 408 logs, 0 orphans); rollback verified; dormant.
- [x] **PRODUCTION CERTIFIED** for controlled/manual enrichment — `PRODUCTION_CERTIFICATION.md`, `RELEASE_1.1.md`, tag `lead-enrichment-v1.1`.

## Sprint 28 update (2026-07-07) — execution layer deployed
- [x] **`OA_EnrichmentOrchestrator`/`OA_EnrichmentQueueable`/`OA_ProposalAdapter` deployed to prod (Active, dormant)**; operational rehearsal passed (0 writes). `LEAD_ENRICHMENT_COMMISSIONING_REPORT.md`.
- [ ] Visual monitoring (dashboards/reports/alerts) — build via **admin UI** (metadata deploy impractical); specs in `DASHBOARD_*.md`.
- [ ] Least-privilege runtime user (replace MAD `oauser`); Census/SEC/SAM credentials.

## Sprint 30 — CLOSED (operational baseline `lead-enrichment-ops-v1.1`)
- [x] Census + SEC Named Credentials deployed + live-tested (HTTP 200) → USASpending/IRS/Census/SEC READY; SAM BLOCKED (external creds).
- [x] Daily operating procedure (`DAILY_ENRICHMENT_OPERATING_PROCEDURE.md`) + final closure (`LEAD_ENRICHMENT_FINAL_CLOSURE.md`).
- [ ] UI dashboards/alerts (`MONITORING_UI_BUILD_GUIDE.md`) · [ ] least-priv user (license) · [ ] SAM key — **operational maintenance, not engineering.**

## Go/No-Go
🟢 **GO / CERTIFIED for controlled/manual enrichment**; program **CLOSED** at ops baseline. 🔴 **NO-GO for scheduled/batch/24×7** until UI monitoring + least-privilege user + SAM key.
